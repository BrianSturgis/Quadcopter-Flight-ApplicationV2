## Name of Project: Quadcopter Flight Application Version 2.0

the user’s interaction with the aircraft for quick use.

project correctly with best practices.
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific
to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
• React
• Node.js and udp4 sockets
• Socket.io
• Next.js
• Html/CSS
• JavaScript

additional tools
• Anime.Js (possible UI animation solution)
• Adobe PhotoShop (wireframe/layout/CSS guide)
• Adobe XD (prototyping)

### Is there anything else you would like your instructor to know?
This project is already at a version 1.0 in its current state and I wish to take it to a version 1.5 to 2.0
with features listed above. My UI is really where I want to put the focus on as I want to be a
designer who codes, and I really feel I have not been able to stretch those wings yet. At best,
the app now has a low fidelity wire frame, and I would like to take it further. The over arching
goal of the project is to build an application with best practices and apply new features using
the git workflow as I feel this is good practice for my future.
